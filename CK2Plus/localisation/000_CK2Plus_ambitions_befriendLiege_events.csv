EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_befriendLiege_001;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], approached me after a council meeting today and asking me to join [From.GetHerHim] for supper.

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_befriendLiege_011;I was sitting alone when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me if I wanted to spar with [From.GetHerHim]. I had a lot of fun... perhaps I should consider training with [From.GetHerHim] more often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
