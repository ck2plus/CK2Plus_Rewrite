EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0000;We started early, the sun had barely risen above the horizon. There was plenty of prey, the dogs caught many rabbits and I slayed one great boar before he killed my horse and myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0000;I'm a hunter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0000;That lifestyle is not for me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0001;The new bird is almost too perfect. I enjoy every hunt with her, and the cook has trouble finding new recipes for rabbit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0001;I'm a falconer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0002;I'm never happier than when I'm in my study, poring over some newly imported volume. Books are truly God's greatest gift to man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0002;I'm a scholar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0003;I found the strange book collecting dust in a forgotten corner of the castle library. It took me several weeks of intense study before its mystery revealed itself to me. The gibberish parts was encoded and after many hours trying to decipher I managed to break it and construct a key to make it easier for me to read. Its mystery is still not solved...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0003;I'm a mystic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0004;My regular excursions into the dungeon have only served to whet my appetite. I have sent for a skilled torturer who will teach me more about the arts of pain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0004;I'm an impaler;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0005;My garden is the apple of my eye, my pride and joy. I distrust my gardener and would spend every hour of the day in my garden if I could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0005;I'm a gardener;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0006;My modest attempts to write poetry were never meant to be published in any way, but wherever I go, bards and minstrels are reciting or singing my poems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0006;I'm a poet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0007;There is nothing that brings me more joy than the day-to-day task of ruling [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Some may think it lacks glory, but I do it well enough that I've become known for my prowess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0007;I'm an administrator!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0008;This lifestyle of utmost pleasure and joyous life suits me perfectly. This can be nothing but heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0008;I'm a hedonist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0009;The duel was close fought, but in the end I was victorious over my opponent. As I basked in the admiration of my peers, I knew that I had to do this again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0009;I'm a duelist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0010;I have finally become an expert in Islamic jurisprudence! My knowledge of the Qur'an, the Sunnah, Ijma' (Consensus) and Qiyas (Analogy) is what makes me a faqih and I will use that knowledge to be a better [Root.GetTitle] and ruler of my people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0010;I am proud to have become a faqih!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0011;Whenever the engineers are working in [Root.Capital.GetName], I always make an effort to visit them and talk. They have such interesting ideas! Building things has always been a pleasure for me, whether they be physical or far more abstract.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0011;I'm an architect!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0012;What goes on behind a battle is far more interesting to me than the actual fighting. Strategies, manoeuvres, even the issues of attrition and supply...these are the things that matter most when it comes to victory, and it applies to far more things than simply the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0012;I'm a strategist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0013;Spending time with other people--that's what gives me energy. Talking with them, knowing the things they want or don't want. I've always had a knack for it, and wherever I go you're bound to find me in the centre of the largest and loudest group.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0013;I'm a socializer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0014;I watch everything, and I listen. Other people don't see what I see--the cause and effect of every action, the moves and counter-moves that are required to make something happen. When I take action, it's very likely nobody will even know I did it. That is how plans succeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0014;I'm a schemer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0015;Playing a game well means understanding its inner workings. You must know the rules, you must know your opponent's strengths and weaknesses. It is life and politics played out on the chessboard. I play because I win, and I like winning...and, yes, sometimes just for fun. What could be better?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0015;I'm a gamer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0016;On a stormy but otherwise peaceful night in [Root.Capital.GetName], a traveling [Root.Religion.GetName] merchant takes refuge in your holding. He seems like an interesting man, and you've nothing else to distract you. How do you spend the evening?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0016;Entertaining him, of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0016;Discussing fighting techniques with his guards;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0016;Debating him on matters of history;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0016;Relaxing by myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0017;There is a social event happening this evening in [Root.Capital.GetName], one of the most important [Root.Capital.Religion.GetName] holidays. Everyone of importance will be partaking in the revelry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0017;Of course I will attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0017;I will watch everyone closely;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0017;This is a good opportunity to meet the merchants;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0017;They can do without me for one evening;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0018;On a quiet day in [Location.GetName], you can't help but notice some of your knights sparring. One of them is doing a poor job of it, and the other men are making sport of his failures rather than helping him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0018;Time to show them all a few tricks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0018;I'll intervene, and perhaps raise morale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0018;They need a lecture on good [Root.Religion.GetName] virtues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0018;I will relax and leave them to it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0019;You overhear some courtiers in [Root.Location.GetName] arguing about the war. The disagreement is clearly about how a ruler could best contribute to victory. When they see you, they immediately go quiet and leave...but afterwards, you decide you have your own answer to their issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0019;By leading the armies into battle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0019;By knowing what happens before the enemy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0019;By keeping the armies fed and paid;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0019;By staying alive;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0020;Peace reigns in the [Root.TopLiege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and for once you are left with nothing to do and no councillors vying for your personal attention. An unusual circumstance, to be sure, but one you can easily solve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0020;There are always matters of ruling to attend to;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0020;I shall call for a hunt in the nearby woods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0020;Time for reading? That almost never happens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0020;I will spend it with my loved ones;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0021;You are riding with attendants through [Root.Capital.GetName] when you hear a disturbance ahead. One of your men suggests that you steer around it, as it appears to be some kind of violent dispute in the market between merchants. Hopefully it does not get out of hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0021;I will intervene and resolve their dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0021;I will speak with the men and calm the situation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0021;I will watch to see what's happening, and why;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0021;I have larger issues upon which to focus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0022;Every time I think of my rival, [target_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], I wonder what I would do if [target_rival.GetSheHe] were here before me now, alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0022;Find out what [target_rival.GetSheHe] has planned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0022;Kill [target_rival.GetHerHim], if I could;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0022;Try to resolve our differences;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0022;There's no use indulging such fantasies;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0023;I can't stop thinking about my plot to [Root.GetPlot]. So many plans to make, but none of them seem to come to fruition fast enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0023;Then I will make more plans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0023;I will distract myself in the study;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0023;Time to busy myself at court;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0023;I will find a way! I must!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0024;You spend an evening with [debater.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] as [debater.GetSheHe] goes on at length about the importance of [debater.Religion.GetName] virtues. It turns into a lively debate, and one [debater.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] seems insistent on winning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0024;Win a debate? Against me? Hah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0024;I'll skillfully steer us onto another topic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0024;[debater.GetSheHeCap] can't win--I cheat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0024;I'll let [debater.GetHerHim] win--this time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0025;A traveling merchant comes to [Root.Capital.GetName], and it appears he has quite an assortment of rare books to offer. He is naturally quite eager to show them to you, and gauge your interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0025;I will take them all, if I can;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0025;Does he have anything on warfare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0025;A treatise on governance would be interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_PlusAmbitions_lifestyle_0025;I would rather save my coin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
